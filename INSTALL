perl Makefile.PL;
make;
make test;
make install;

To build and install (optional) DBMS support:
 
cd dbms;
make;
make install;
 
NOTE: the dbmsd(8) code uses old Berkeley DB 1.x style interface. If you can not get it compile, do not disperate and try to use perl land BerkleyDB, DB_File or SDBM_File styles instead :-)

(by default the dbmsd get installed under the /RDFStore branch)
