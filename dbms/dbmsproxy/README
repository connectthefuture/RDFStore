Problem
	Some utilities quickly need
	to get a value from the DBMS.

	However setting up a tcp
	scoket, having de dbmsd
	pass it of to a handler
	and a teardown is relatively
	expensive for just a get.

Solution
	a proxy which bundles the
	requests.

A simple 'GET' based proxy which
is contineously connected to a
specific DBMS backend and table.

Locally it exposes a unix domain
socket; to which applications 
can quickly and efficiently connect,
get a value, and disconnect.

Usage
---

for testing:
	./dbmsproxy -U -X dbms://localhost/test100
or in the background:
	./dbmsproxy -p /var/tmp/test100.sock dbms://localhost/test100

Put some data in the db

	vi test.pl
	perl test.pl

And fetch it

	./dbmsget -d /var/tmp/test100.sock
or
	echo foo bar | ./dbmsget
