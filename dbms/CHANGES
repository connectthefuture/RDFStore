	include/dbms.h
		- added bt_compare_fcn_type to dbms struct

	include/dbms_comms.h
		- added TOKEN_FROM

	deamon/hanlder.c
		- added TOKEN_FROM handler for from() operation
		- added bt_compare_fcn_type paramter management to receive from client
                - fixed bug in frist(), next() methods to use the right macros depending on BDB version

        libdbms/libdbms.c
                - updated to use debug malloc/free

version 1.2.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Abstracted out a libdbms(.a) which contains all
	the communciation code and does better error handling.
	the perl side is now just a wrapper.

	Abstracted/moved all specific things into a compat header 
	file (see include/*compat*).

	Renamed directory DBMS to client and added client/stub.[ch]

	include/dbms.h
		- added TOKEN_DEC for atomic decrement
		- added TOKEN_PACKINC for atomic packed increment
		- added TOKEN_PACKDEC for atomic packed decrement

	deamon/deamon.h
		- added definitions for BDB > 1.8x support

	deamon/hanlder.c
		- added basic BDB > 1.8x support
		- added atomic decrement support via do_dec()
		- added atomic packed increment support via do_packinc()
		- added atomic packed decrement support via do_packdec()

	client/DBMS.xs
		- updated perl/XS glue code
		- added atomic decrement - see DEC()
		- moved client related definitions in client/stub.h
		- moved code to main RDFStore.xs to avoid dynamic linking problems of libdbms.so

	client/DBMS.pm
		- added atomic decrement - see dec()
		- moved one level up to main rdfstore dist dir (see ../lib)

version 1.1.1.1 - 2001/01/18 09:53:20
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	A a new version of dbmsd has been made. Most of this code come from one of the
	leatest version authored by Dirk Willem-van Gulik early 1999. Since version 0.1
	I simpy posted his code almost untouched, but due the fact dirk left since a year
	ago I will take over the dbmsd project. I am not a C guru and volunteers are
	welcome. What is new:

		- dirk started with multi-thread supported but it was never finished that
		  I know of
		- some bug fixing to get it compiled on Irix and Solaris has been made
		- dbmsd still use BerkeleyDB 1.x style interface

	Now DBMS runs fine on Linux platforms (tested on SuSE Linux Linux 2.2.16) by using the
	Sleepycat BDB 1.85 compatibility API (namely libdb1 and db_185.h). The user needs to edit
	the deamon/Makefile to link with the right library.

	DBMS/typemap
		- Fixed bug to make it compile on old and recent Perl5 versions

	Makefile
		- general update. Added make depend for deamon

	deamon/children.c
		- added platform check to include compatibility code db_185.h

	deamon/deamon.c
		- added platform check to include compatibility code db_185.h

	deamon/deamon.h
		- added platform check to include compatibility code db_185.h

	deamon/handler.c
		- added platform check to include compatibility code db_185.h

	deamon/loop.c
		- added platform check to include compatibility code db_185.h

	deamon/main.c
		- added platform check to include compatibility code db_185.h

	deamon/Makefile
		- commented out a few options and cleaned up a few things
		- added (optional) libdb1 to get DBMS compile on Linux

	deamon/README
		- included README file originally written by dirk
	
	utils
		- moved original utils/dbcat_raw utils to dbsm dirs

	doc
		- added documentation section
		- added dbms.html contribution by dirkx@webweaving.org
	
	INSTALL
		- added installation instructions

	deamon/handler.c
		- commented out sys/syslimits.h (already included by sys/param.h)
