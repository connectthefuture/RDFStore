Revision history for Perl extension RDFStore.

version 1.1.1.1 2001/01/18 09:53:20
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	A a new version of dbmsd has been made. Most of this code come from one of the
	leatest version authored by Dirk Willem-van Gulik early 1999. Since version 0.1
	I simpy posted his code almost untouched, but due the fact dirk left since a year
	ago I will take over the dbmsd project. I am not a C guru and volunteers are
	welcome. What is new:

		- dirk started with multi-thread supported but it was never finished that
		  I know of
		- some bug fixing to get it compiled on Irix and Solaris has been made
		- dbmsd still use BerkeleyDB 1.x style interface

	Now DBMS runs fine on Linux platforms (tested on SuSE Linux Linux 2.2.16) by using the
	Sleepycat BDB 1.85 compatibility API (namely libdb1 and db_185.h). The user needs to edit
	the deamon/Makefile to link with the right library.
