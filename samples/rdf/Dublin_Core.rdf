      <rdfs:comment>A person or organization not specified in a Creator

      <rdfs:label>Date</rdfs:label>
      <rdfs:comment>A date associated with the creation or availability of
      the resource. Such a date is not to be confused with one belonging
      in the Coverage element, which would be associated with the resource
      only insofar as the intellectual content is somehow about that
      date. Recommended best practice is defined in a profile of ISO 8601
      [Date and Time Formats (based on ISO8601), W3C Technical Note,
      http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime] that includes (among others)
      dates of the forms YYYY and YYYY-MM-DD. In this scheme, for example,
      the date 1994-11-05 corresponds to November 5, 1994.</rdfs:comment>

      <rdfs:label>Type</rdfs:label>
      <rdfs:comment>The category of the resource, such as home page,
      novel, poem, working paper, technical report, essay, dictionary. For
      the sake of interoperability, Type should be selected from an
      enumerated list that is currently under development in the workshop
      series.</rdfs:comment>

      <rdfs:label>Format</rdfs:label>
      <rdfs:comment>The data format of the resource, used to identify the
      software and possibly hardware that might be needed to display or
      operate the resource. For the sake of interoperability, Format
      should be selected from an enumerated list that is currently under
      development in the workshop series.</rdfs:comment>

      <rdf:type rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property"/>
      <rdfs:label>Identifier</rdfs:label>
      <rdfs:comment>A string or number used to uniquely identify the
      resource. Examples for networked resources include URLs and URNs
      (when implemented). Other globally-unique identifiers, such as
      International Standard Book Numbers (ISBN) or other formal names are
      also candidates for this element.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdf:Description ID="Source">
      <rdf:type rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property"/>
      <rdfs:label>Source</rdfs:label>
      <rdfs:comment>Information about a second resource from which the
      present resource is derived. While it is generally recommended that
      elements contain information about the present resource only, this
      element may contain a date, creator, format, identifier, or other
      metadata for the second resource when it is considered important for
      discovery of the present resource; recommended best practice is to
      use the Relation element instead.  For example, it is possible to
      use a Source date of 1603 in a description of a 1996 film adaptation
      of a Shakespearean play, but it is preferred instead to use Relation
      "IsBasedOn" with a reference to a separate resource whose
      description contains a Date of 1603. Source is not applicable if the
      present resource is in its original form.</rdfs:comment>

      <rdfs:label>Language</rdfs:label>
      <rdfs:comment>The language of the intellectual content of the
      resource. Where practical, the content of this field should coincide
      with RFC 1766 [Tags for the Identification of Languages,
      http://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1766.txt ]; examples include en, de,
      es, fi, fr, ja, th, and zh.</rdfs:comment>

      <rdfs:label>Relation</rdfs:label>
      <rdfs:comment>An identifier of a second resource and its
      relationship to the present resource. This element permits links
      between related resources and resource descriptions to be
      indicated. Examples include an edition of a work (IsVersionOf), a
      translation of a work (IsBasedOn), a chapter of a book (IsPartOf),
      and a mechanical transformation of a dataset into an image
      (IsFormatOf). For the sake of interoperability, relationships should
      be selected from an enumerated list that is currently under
      development in the workshop series.</rdfs:comment>

      <rdf:type rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property"/>
      <rdfs:label>Coverage</rdfs:label>
      <rdfs:comment>The spatial or temporal characteristics of the
      intellectual content of the resource. Spatial coverage refers to a
      physical region (e.g., celestial sector); use coordinates (e.g.,
      longitude and latitude) or place names that are from a controlled
      list or are fully spelled out. Temporal coverage refers to what the
      resource is about rather than when it was created or made available
      (the latter belonging in the Date element); use the same date/time
      format (often a range) [Date and Time Formats (based on ISO8601),
      W3C Technical Note, http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime] as
      recommended for the Date element or time periods that are from a
      controlled list or are fully spelled out.</rdfs:comment>

      <rdfs:comment>A rights management statement, an identifier that
      links to a rights management statement, or an identifier that links
      to a service providing information about rights management for the
      resource.</rdfs:comment>
