use Carp;

use RDFStore::Model;
use DBI;

my $Usage =<<EOU;
Usage is:
    $0 [-h] [-v] -storename <IDENTIFIER> [-syntax <RDF/XML | NTriples> ]

Query an existing RDFStore database.

-h	Print this message

-storename <IDENTIFIER>
		RDFStore database name IDENTIFIER is like rdfstore://[HOSTNAME[:PORT]]/PATH/DBDIRNAME

                        E.g. URLs
                                        rdfstore://mysite.foo.com:1234/this/is/my/rd/store/database
                                        rdfstore:///root/this/is/my/rd/store/database

[-syntax <RDF/XML | NTriples> ]
		By default is (normalized) RDF/XML - otherwise you can specify N-Triples

[-v]	Be verbose
