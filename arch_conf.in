# This software consists of work developed by Alberto Reggiori and

# The DBMS TCP/IP server part is based on software originally written

# 1. Where is the file db.h?
#
#    Change the path below to point to the directory where db.h is
#    installed on your system.

INCLUDE	= /usr/local/BerkeleyDB/include
#INCLUDE	= /usr/local/include
#INCLUDE	= /usr/include

# 2. Where is libdb?
#
#    Change the path below to point to the directory where libdb is
#    installed on your system.

LIB	= /usr/local/BerkeleyDB/lib
#LIB	= /usr/local/lib
#LIB	= /usr/lib

# 3. Is the library called libdb?
#
#    If you have copies of both 1.x and 2.x Berkeley DB installed on
#    your system it can sometimes be tricky to make sure you are using
#    the correct one. Renaming one (or creating a symbolic link) to
#    include the version number of the library can help.
#
#    For example, if you have both Berkeley DB 2.3.12 and 1.85 on your
#    system and you want to use the Berkeley DB version 2 library you
#    could rename the version 2 library from libdb.a to libdb-2.3.12.a and
#    change the DBNAME line below to look like this:
#
#        DBNAME = -ldb-2.3.12
#
#    That will ensure you are linking the correct version of the DB
#    library.
#
#    Note: If you are building this module with Win32, -llibdb will be
#    used by default. For all the other platforms it will default to -ldb .
#
#    If you have changed the name of the library, uncomment the line
#    below (by removing the leading #) and edit the line to use the name
#    you have picked.
 
#DBNAME = -ldb-4.0

# 4. DBMSD installation directory
#
#    See dbms/deamon/dbmsd.8

DBMS_INSTDIR = /RDFStore
